### What I learned

During this particular challenge, I encountered several new and unfamiliar obstacles. However, I was able to overcome them. I relied heavily on resources such as Google, Stack Overflow, and W3Schools, especially when implementing the card hover effect that changes content when the mouse is over it. Furthermore, I am proud to have made the design fully responsive and optimized for all mobile devices. Overall, this challenge was a great achievement for me, as it tested my problem-solving skills and allowed me to learn and grow as a developer. I am excited to take on more challenges in the future and continue honing my craft.
